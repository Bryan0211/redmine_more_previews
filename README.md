Please note, that not all conversions have been thoroughly tested yet. Please send files for a conversion test to me, if you are uncertain if your files get converted an can be viewed in a browser. Further, please note that the conversion accuracy strongly depends on the availability of installed fonts. Please consult the LibreOffice portals to see how to install fonts.
